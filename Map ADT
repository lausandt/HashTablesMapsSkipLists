Map ADT

A Map M is a collection of Key Values pairs modeled as entries. Keys need to be unique, keys can map to the same value

size(): Returns the number of entries in M

isEmpty(): Returns a boolean indicating if the is empty or not

get(k): Returns the value v associated with key k if such an entry exists, otherwise returns null

put(k,v): if M does not have an entry wit key equal to k, then adds entry (k,v) to M and returns null. Else
          replaces the existing value of entry (k,v) with v and returns the old value

remove(K): Removes from M the entry with key equal to k and returns it's value. If M has no such entry returns null

keySet(): Returns an iterable collection containing all keys stored in M

values(): Returns an iterable collection containing all the values of entries stored in M (with possible duplicates)

entrySet(): returns an iterable collection of all key-value entries in M
