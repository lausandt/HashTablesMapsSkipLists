Sorted Map ADT

Standard map behaviour 

size(): Returns the number of entries in M

isEmpty(): Returns a boolean indicating if the is empty or not

get(k): Returns the value v associated with key k if such an entry exists, otherwise returns null

put(k,v): if M does not have an entry wit key equal to k, then adds entry (k,v) to M and returns null. Else
          replaces the existing value of entry (k,v) with v and returns the old value

remove(K): Removes from M the entry with key equal to k and returns it's value. If M has no such entry returns null

keySet(): Returns an iterable collection containing all keys stored in M

values(): Returns an iterable collection containing all the values of entries stored in M (with possible duplicates)

entrySet(): returns an iterable collection of all key-value entries in M

Extended behaviour 

firstEntry(): Returns the entry with the smallest key value, or null if the map is empty

lastEntry(): Returns the entry with the largest key value or null if the map is empty

ceilingEntry(k): Return the entry with the least key value bigger than or equal to the given key, null if no such entry exists

floorEntry(k):  Return the entry with the biggest key value smaller than or equal to the given key, null if no such entry exists
 
lowerEntry(k):  Return the entry with the greatest key value strictly smaller than the given key, null if no such entry exists 

higherEntry(k): Return the entry with the least key value strictly greater than the given key, null if no such entry exists 

subMap(k1, k2): Returns an iteration of all entries greater than pr equal to k1, but strictlt less than k2
